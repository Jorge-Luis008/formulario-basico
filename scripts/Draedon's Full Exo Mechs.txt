    From the inspiration of the Wither's conception, but perfected, this machine can inflict a corrosive
    substance that makes the wither's effect like a mild headache
XO-08 Oceanus: (Elder Guardian)
    Inpired by the design of the guardians that inhabit the ocean monuments this machine can swiftly sail the oceans
    or the skies at mach speed while tracking down its target while charging lasers that resemble those used

XSk-02 Phobos: (Warden)
    A terrifing automaton based on the already terrifing Wardens that roam the skulk caverns, but suited to fight more
    that to protect. Fitted with amplifiers that can blast devastating sound waves in a general direction and heavy
    platted armor, it is bound to take a long while to defeat this machine.
